Now the wolf runs to the house of bricks. The three little pigs are in the house. He knocks on the door. "Can I come in, little pigs? I’m not very big!" he says. Percy, Peter and Patrick say, "Go away! You can’t come in. You’re the big, bad wolf, you horrible thing." The wolf blows and blows, and he blows and blows again, but the house doesn’t fall down. It’s a house of bricks and it’s very strong. The wolf sits down and thinks. "I can wait," he says. The three little pigs, Percy, Peter and Patrick are in the house. They are hungry. "The wolf is waiting. We can’t go out. We can’t get dinner," says Percy. "What can we do?" asks Peter. "Don’t be sad. It’s OK," says the clever pig, Patrick. "I’ve got an idea. Let’s make a fire." The three little pigs make a big fire.
