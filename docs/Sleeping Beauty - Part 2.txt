It’s a bad fairy. She is very ugly. Everybody is afraid of her. The bad fairy is angry because the King didn’t ask her to come to the party. "I want to give the princess my present," says the bad fairy. She points to the baby princess and she says. "When she’s sixteen, she’ll cut her finger on a spinning wheel and die!" The bad fairy laughs and leaves. Everybody is very sad. But the seventh fairy can help. "Don’t worry. Here’s my present. The princess won’t die. She will sleep for one hundred years," she says. "Then a prince will kiss her and she will wake up." The King and Queen are afraid. The King wants to hide all the spinning wheels. He sends a messenger to the town. "Hide your spinning wheels. We must save the princess," says the messenger.
