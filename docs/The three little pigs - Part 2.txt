But a big bad wolf lives in the forest. Every day the wolf watches the pigs. He is hungry and he wants to eat them. He looks at the house of straw and he says, "I can smell a little pig. I want to eat him for my dinner,". The big bad wolf jumps over the red fence. He goes to the house of straw and he knocks on the door. "Can I come in, little pig? I’m not very big!" he says. But Percy sees it is a big bad wolf. He says, "Go away! You can’t come in. You’re a big bad wolf, you horrible thing." But the wolf blows and blows and the house falls down. "Help!" shouts Percy. He runs to his brother Peter’s house. Now the wolf is very hungry. He wants his dinner. He runs to the house of wood and he knocks on the door. "Can I come in, little pigs? I’m not very big!" he says. But Percy and Peter say, "Go away! You can’t come in. You’re the big bad wolf, you horrible thing." But the wolf blows and blows and the house falls down. "Help!" shout Percy and Peter. They run to their brother Patrick’s house.
