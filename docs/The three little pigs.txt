The three little pigs are brothers. They are going into the forest. They want to build three houses. "Let’s build our houses here," says the first little pig, Percy. "Yes," says the second little pig, Peter. "That’s a good idea," says the third little pig, Patrick. The first little pig, Percy, gets some straw and he starts to build a house of straw. He sings, "Hum de hum, dum de dum, hee de dum, dee de hum," when he works. The second little pig, Peter, gets some wood and he starts to build a house of wood. He sings, "Hum de hum, dum de dum, hee de dum, dee de hum," when he works. The third pig, Patrick, is very clever. He gets some bricks and he starts to build a house of bricks. He sings, "Hum de hum, dum de dum, hee de dum, dee de hum," when he works. Now all the houses are ready. The three little pigs make a fence and they paint it red.
